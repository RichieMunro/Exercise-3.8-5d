total = 1 
for num in ["12","10","32","3","66","17","42","99","20"]: 
    total *= int(num)
    
print("The sum is:", total)


#Issue: Problem with Initial Setup: You initially set total = 0 and used += as you did with the summation exercise. This setup didnâ€™t work because: 0 is the identity for addition but not for multiplication. Multiplying any number by 0 results in 0, so starting with 0 would always yield a final product of 0. Using += adds numbers rather than multiplying them.
#Solution: Adjust Initialization and Operation: Change Initialization: Set total = 1 (or use a variable named product = 1) so it can accumulate the product correctly without resetting to zero. Use *= for Multiplication: Replace += with *= to multiply the running product by each number in the list. This way, each number is multiplied with the cumulative product as you iterate through the list.
#Lesson Learned:
#Variable Initialization: Different operations require different initial values. For summation, start with 0. For multiplication (product), start with 1. Using += vs. *=: += is for addition, while *= is for multiplication. Choose the operator that matches the intended operation. Persistence in Problem Solving: This exercise reinforced the importance of adjusting approaches based on specific requirements. Even a small change, like switching += to *=, can significantly affect results.
